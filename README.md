# Hamster.js
A lingt-weight javascript game engine

### Start
You should have Node development environment,and the version of Node must more than 4.0.

So,if above all no problem,you can use the git clone command to loaded Hamster,and in the root directory use npm install.

After all packages are installed we use 'npm start' to launch it.

### API
There is no any API now,you just can lern the function how to used in the source code.But I will add this as soon as possible.
